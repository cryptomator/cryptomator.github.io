- Question: "How does Cryptomator differ from other encryption tools like VeraCrypt?"
  Answer: "Cryptomator is specifically designed for use with cloud services and provides file-based encryption, meaning each file is encrypted individually. This allows for efficient synchronization with cloud providers like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. Cryptomator is easy to use, supports mobile platforms (Android and iOS), and also encrypts filenames and folder structures for maximum privacy. VeraCrypt, on the other hand, is better suited for encrypting entire drives, partitions, or container files on local devices. It offers extensive configuration options but is more complex to use and less optimized for cloud integration."
- Question: "Can I use Cryptomator without the cloud?"
  Answer: "Yes, you can use Cryptomator to encrypt files on your local device, a USB flash drive, or a network folder without syncing them to the cloud."
- Question: "Can I use Cryptomator with multiple cloud providers at the same time?"
  Answer: "Yes, Cryptomator is not tied to a specific cloud provider. You can create multiple vaults and sync them with different cloud services."
- Question: "Are there any limitations on file size or the number of files in a vault?"
  Answer: "The maximum file size and number of files depend primarily on the limitations of your cloud provider or your device's storage capacity, not on Cryptomator."
- Question: "What happens if I uninstall Cryptomator?"
  Answer: "Your encrypted files remain intact and can be decrypted at any time by reinstalling Cryptomator."
