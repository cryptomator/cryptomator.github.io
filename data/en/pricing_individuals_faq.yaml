- Question: "Is Cryptomator free to use?"
  Answer: "Cryptomator is free to use on Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS, but not Android (yet). However, the free version on iOS is read-only. If you purchase a license key for one platform, it is not valid for another. A bundle license does not exist."
- Question: "Why is Cryptomator free to use on some platforms, but not on others?"
  Answer: "Our licensing strategy differs across platforms because of constraints imposed by App Store / Google Play policies, and technical differences across operating systems."
- Question: "Do I need a supporter certificate to use Cryptomator on Desktop?"
  Answer: "All functional and encryption features are absolutely free to use on the desktop. By obtaining a supporter certificate, you can unlock the dark mode on desktop apps and also help accelerate Cryptomator's development. Please note, a supporter certificate is not a license key that can be used to unlock mobile apps."
- Question: "How can I purchase Cryptomator on Android?"
  Answer: "It is a one-time purchase through Google Play or as an APK download from our website or through F-Droid. If you buy the app without going through Google Play, you will receive an Android-only license key. You cannot test the app before purchasing it, but you have a right of withdrawal within 14 days."
- Question: "How can I purchase Cryptomator on iOS?"
  Answer: "We use a freemium model on iOS. You can download the Cryptomator app from the App Store for free and use it in read-only mode indefinitely. A one-time in-app purchase through the App Store will grant you write access."
- Question: "Is there a freemium version of Cryptomator for Android?"
  Answer: "Not yet, but we have plans to introduce a freemium model on Android like we have on iOS. You can keep up with our progress by following [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/cryptomator/android/issues/428). Stay tuned!"
- Question: "Can I avoid big-tech/gatekeepers for my purchase?"
  Answer: "This is possible on Android only, as you can download the Cryptomator app as an APK file or through F-Droid and buy the license using our website. The supporter certificate can only be purchased using our website."
- Question: "Can I purchase Cryptomator anonymously?"
  Answer: "Yes, you can buy a Cryptomator for Android license key or a supporter certificate through [ProxyStore](https://digitalgoods.proxysto.re/en). They accept Monero, Bitcoin, and cash. You can read more about our cooperation [here](/coop/proxystore/)."
