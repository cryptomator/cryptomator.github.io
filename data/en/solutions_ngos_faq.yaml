- Question: "How does Cryptomator Hub protect sensitive data like donor information or project files?"
  Answer: "All data is encrypted on the client side using a zero-knowledge approach. This means no cloud provider, server, or third party – not even your own IT department – has access to the content."
- Question: "Is Cryptomator Hub suitable for organizations with distributed teams or international operations?"
  Answer: "Yes. Vaults can be structured flexibly and shared securely with local teams, partner organizations, or temporary staff – even across borders."
- Question: "Can we use Cryptomator Hub with existing cloud services like OneDrive, Google Drive, or Nextcloud?"
  Answer: "Yes. Cryptomator Hub works independently of the cloud provider you use. Encrypted vaults appear as regular folders in your familiar environment – whether hosted in the public cloud or on your own infrastructure."
- Question: "How do we manage access rights in changing project teams?"
  Answer: "Permissions can be assigned based on roles, adjusted at any time, and revoked when needed. All access and changes are fully logged – including for external partners or auditors."
- Question: "What happens to shared data when someone leaves the organization?"
  Answer: "Access can be revoked immediately without losing any data. The content remains available to other authorized users within the vault."
- Question: "Do we need special IT knowledge to manage Cryptomator Hub?"
  Answer: "No. Management is done via an intuitive web interface. For advanced scenarios, we provide detailed documentation, integrations, and responsive support."
