      Walbusch faced the challenge of reliably protecting sensitive company data, particularly personal customer data and internal business documents. An additional catalyst was the discontinuation of Boxcryptor, which Walbusch had previously used. This created urgent need for action to find a new, trustworthy, and long-term available security solution for encrypted data storage.

  - title: "Implementation of Cryptomator Hub"

      After careful market analysis, Walbusch decided on Cryptomator Hub. The solution was implemented across departments - from the IT department to the works council and executive management. A practical example: At Walbusch, function-based vaults are used that are provided to employees as network drives. This makes the additional security layer virtually invisible in daily work, as access to data is possible without detours after unlocking the vaults. Only when opening very large files can slightly longer loading times occasionally occur. Overall, Cryptomator Hub integrates seamlessly into the existing system environment and supports employees without significant restrictions.
      
      "For our employees, it was crucial that the security effort in daily operations remains low - exactly what Cryptomator Hub offers us."

      The implementation process gave Walbusch the opportunity to specifically modernize existing security processes.
      
      The data previously encrypted in Boxcryptor was successfully and reliably transferred to Cryptomator Hub. Accompanying this, the IT department organized practical training and provided comprehensive documentation in the internal wiki, so that employees could quickly familiarize themselves with the new solution. The onboarding process was also structured and smooth: When unlocking vaults for the first time, IT and specialized departments supported hand in hand - a collaboration that made the transition particularly efficient.
      
      Furthermore, Cryptomator Hub significantly contributed to overcoming existing challenges in data security. Particularly appreciated is the combination of end-to-end encryption and role-based permission management. This ensures sensitive data is reliably protected while clear access rights simplify internal processes. This not only increased security but also supported compliance with internal governance requirements.

      Through the use of Cryptomator Hub, Walbusch was able to sustainably ensure data security. Particularly valuable was that existing work processes could be maintained without major changes - the solution integrated seamlessly into daily work and required only minor adjustments.
      
      A clear advantage was that sensitive information is reliably protected and compliance requirements are met without employees having to change their familiar processes. This enabled the company to achieve a high level of security without affecting productivity.
      
      Even though collaborative real-time work is not yet included in the feature set, Walbusch has already achieved significant benefits. The gained stability and reliable protection of sensitive data provide a solid foundation for future developments.

  - title: "Recommendations and Endorsements"
    anchor: "recommendations"

      Walbusch emphasizes that Cryptomator Hub stands out compared to other security solutions through its simple integration, high flexibility, and full transparency. Particularly appreciated is that the solution, as open-source software, is traceable and trustworthy, and reliably ensures data security with strong AES-256 encryption.
      
      For Walbusch, Cryptomator Hub therefore represents not only an immediate solution for current challenges, but also a forward-looking platform that offers space for automation and extensions and can be closely integrated with common collaboration tools.
