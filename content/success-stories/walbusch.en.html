      Walbusch GmbH & Co. KG is a long-established fashion company based in Solingen, Germany, that focuses on a multichannel approach. In addition to a strong online and mail order business, Walbusch operates numerous stores in German-speaking countries. The company employs more than a thousand people and has been synonymous with high-quality fashion products since its founding in 1934.

      Walbusch faced the challenge of reliably protecting sensitive company data, in particular personal customer data and internal business documents. An additional trigger was the discontinuation of the Boxcryptor product, which Walbusch had previously used. This created an urgent need to find a new, trustworthy, and long-term security solution for encrypted data storage.

      After careful market analysis, Walbusch opted for Cryptomator Hub. The solution was introduced across all departments – from the IT department to the works council to management.

      A practical example: Walbusch uses function-specific safes that are provided to employees as network drives. This makes the additional layer of security virtually invisible in everyday work, as data can be accessed directly after the safes have been unlocked. Overall, Cryptomator Hub integrates smoothly into the existing system environment and supports employees without any significant restrictions.
      
      "It was crucial for our employees that the security effort in everyday life remains low," explains Andreas Cofalla, Application Manager IT at Walbusch. "That's exactly what Cryptomator Hub offers us."

      The implementation process provided Walbusch with an opportunity to modernize existing security procedures in a targeted manner.

      The data previously encrypted in Boxcryptor was successfully and reliably transferred to Cryptomator Hub. In addition, the IT department organized practical training sessions and provided detailed documentation in the internal wiki so that employees could quickly familiarize themselves with the new solution. Onboarding was also structured and smooth: IT and specialist departments worked hand in hand to support the initial activation of the vaults – a collaboration that made the transition particularly efficient.

      Additionally, Cryptomator Hub contributed significantly to overcoming existing challenges in the area of data security. The combination of end-to-end encryption and role-based rights assignment is particularly appreciated. Sensitive data is reliably protected, while clear access rights simplify internal processes. This not only increased security, but also supported compliance with internal compliance requirements.

      By using Cryptomator Hub, Walbusch was able to ensure data security in the long term. It was particularly valuable that existing work processes could be maintained without major changes—the solution integrated seamlessly into everyday work and required only minor adjustments.

      A clear advantage was that sensitive information was reliably protected and compliance requirements were met without employees having to change their usual procedures. This enabled the company to achieve a high level of security without compromising productivity.

    anchor: "recommendations"

      Walbusch emphasizes that Cryptomator Hub stands out from other security solutions thanks to its easy integration, high flexibility, and complete transparency. The company particularly appreciates the fact that the solution is open-source software, which makes it transparent and trustworthy, and that it reliably ensures data security with strong AES-256 encryption. 

      For Walbusch, Cryptomator Hub is therefore not only an immediate solution to current challenges, but also forward-looking software for the long-term protection of confidential company data. Cryptomator Hub offers security and stability in everyday work and integrates seamlessly into familiar processes and common tools.
