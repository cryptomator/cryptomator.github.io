We’re excited to announce a major update for the Cryptomator iOS app: **Cryptomator now supports SharePoint!** This means that businesses and organizations can now store their encrypted vaults directly in SharePoint. Additionally, **Microsoft Teams is also supported**, as files in Teams are stored in SharePoint by default. With this integration, users can now protect their team documents with **end-to-end encryption**.

## Why is this important?

Companies, universities, and NGOs increasingly rely on cloud services like Microsoft 365 for flexible and efficient collaboration. With SharePoint integration, users can ensure that **sensitive documents are not only stored in the cloud but also protected with zero-knowledge encryption**. Even Microsoft has no access to the unencrypted content.

## How the SharePoint Integration Works

Using Cryptomator with SharePoint is just as easy as with other cloud services:

- **Create a new vault or add an existing one**: Select SharePoint as the storage location in the Cryptomator iOS app.
- **Work securely with encrypted files in Microsoft 365**: Access your protected documents within SharePoint or Microsoft Teams.
- **Flexible access across all devices**: Your encrypted files are available on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Maximum Security for Microsoft 365 Users

The integration of SharePoint in Cryptomator 2.7.0 is a **major step forward for businesses that prioritize data protection and compliance**. With this solution, you can:

- Enhance the security of confidential data while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365.
- Meet compliance requirements such as **GDPR** and **NIS-2** more easily.
- Maintain full control over your sensitive information, no matter where it is stored.

## Try It Now!

The **new 2.7.0 update is now available [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cryptomator/id1560822163)**. Update your Cryptomator iOS app today and enjoy **secure SharePoint encryption in the cloud**!
