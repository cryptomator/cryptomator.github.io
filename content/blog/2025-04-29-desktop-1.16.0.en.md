The latest version of our desktop app has been released! **Cryptomator 1.16.0** introduces several exciting new features that make working with encrypted files even more convenient. This update focuses on new functions that provide greater transparency and control over your vaults – and even **biometric unlocking** on Mac!

### What's New?

**EventView: Overview of Important Vault Events**  
Want to know if any conflicts occurred when unlocking a vault or if corrupted files were detected? With the new **EventView**, you now get a clear overview of relevant events within an unlocked vault – such as conflict resolutions or notifications about corrupted files. This way, you always stay informed about what's happening inside your vault.

**Decrypt File Names**  
With the new **Decrypt File Name** feature, you can select encrypted files within a vault and retrieve their original, unencrypted filenames – without needing to open the file itself. A handy tool for anyone needing a quick overview!

**Touch ID Support for macOS**  
Starting now, you can unlock your vaults on **Mac** easily with **Touch ID**! This makes using Cryptomator not only faster but also more convenient and secure – especially on devices with biometric authentication. Thanks to [Ralph (purejava on GitHub)](https://github.com/purejava) for the great support!

### Bugfixes

Of course, we also **fixed several bugs** – here’s a quick overview:

- The **main window** is now displayed correctly again on Windows.
- The **tray icon** now reliably adapts to the OS theme on Linux. Thanks again to Ralph for the help!
- The app now properly quits when the main window is closed (if no tray is active).
- **Supporter certificates** can now be properly removed again.
- In case of **filename conflicts**, the original suffixes provided by your cloud service are now largely preserved – instead of being replaced by a simple numbering system.

### Full Changelog on GitHub

In addition to the highlights mentioned above, there are also **several smaller improvements and updates** – such as enhancements to vault settings, better symbolic icon support on Linux, and translation updates. You can find the complete list of changes as always in the [**Changelog**](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.16.0) on GitHub.

**Thanks to all contributors** from the community – and **enjoy the new update**!
