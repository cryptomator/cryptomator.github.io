## Update 2024-08-19

Weâ€™re pleased to share a positive update regarding the ongoing issue with Google Drive connectivity in Cryptomator for Android and iOS.

We have just received confirmation from the auditing company that the Letter of Approval (LOA) is set to be submitted to Google within the next 1-2 business days. This is the final step in the verification process, and once submitted, we anticipate that Google Drive access will be restored shortly thereafter.

We are cautiously optimistic that full functionality will be available again within the next few days. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued patience and understanding as we work through this final stage.

Hello Community!

We would like to inform you about a current issue that some of you may be experiencing while using our Cryptomator apps for Android and iOS. It involves difficulties in connecting to Google Drive that have arisen in the past few days. Here, you will find all the details and updates on our progress in resolving the issue.

## What Happened?

Google recently introduced significant changes to its app verification system. These changes particularly affect how apps access services like Google Drive. As a result of this update, you may encounter an error message when trying to connect Google Drive with Cryptomator, stating that Cryptomator is blocked because it is an "unverified app".

## Why Is This Issue Occurring?

Google has substantially tightened the requirements for app verification, especially for apps that access sensitive user data. This not only affects Cryptomator but potentially all apps that integrate with Google services. The aim of these changes is to enhance user security and protect their data. However, as a consequence, apps that have not yet fully adapted to the new system may be temporarily blocked.

## What Are We Doing to Resolve the Issue?

We are fully aware of the problem and are working diligently to find a solution. Our team is in close contact with Google to complete the necessary verification processes and re-certify Cryptomator as a trusted app. Unfortunately, this task is more complex than initially anticipated. Google's new requirements necessitate additional adjustments to our app, which must be carefully implemented and tested.

We want to emphasize that the security of your data is our top priority. Therefore, we are taking the time to thoroughly implement these changes to ensure that Cryptomator remains a secure and reliable solution for your encrypted data.

## What Can You Do?

We understand that this issue is frustrating for many of you, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to avoid interrupting your workflow:

1. Use Alternative Cloud Services: If you cannot use Google Drive at the moment, you have the option to integrate alternative cloud services like Dropbox, OneDrive, or WebDAV-based services in Cryptomator.
2. Local Decryption: You can still decrypt your encrypted vaults using the desktop application. If the vault is not that large, you can also download it to your mobile device and decrypt it locally.
3. Monitor Updates: We will keep you regularly informed about the progress of our work. As soon as the issue is resolved, we will promptly notify you with the corresponding updates. Keep an eye on our social media accounts on X and Mastodon for updates.

## Outlook

We are confident that we will be able to provide a solution soon. Our goal is to restore full functionality to Cryptomator as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

Once again, thank you for your support and trust in Cryptomator. We are working tirelessly to provide you with the best possible experience with our app, and we will keep you informed as soon as there are any updates.

Best regards,  
The Cryptomator Team

## FAQ: Google OAuth Issues in Cryptomator for Android and iOS

**Q1: What is the issue with Google Drive and Cryptomator for Android and iOS?**  
**A1:** Users are experiencing issues with Google blocking access to your files when using Cryptomator for Android and iOS during the sign-in process. 

**Q2: How can I access my files? Is there a workaround?**  
**A2:** You can always access your files on your Desktop computer or by copying your vault from your Google Drive to your phone's harddrive and then using Cryptomator for Android and iOS to access them locally. 

**Q3: Are my files safe? Is my account safe?**  
**A3:** Yes. Your files and account both are safe and at no risk of being deleted or accessed by malicious actors. They are not any less safe than they were a week ago.
Also your files are still encrypted.

**Q4: Is there a problem with my Google account?**  
**A4:** No. This is not a problem with your Google account and this should affect all users of Cryptomator for Android and iOS and Google Drive.

**Q5: Is Cryptomator for Android and iOS safe?**  
**A5:** Yes. Cryptomator for Android is safe and we are currently not aware of any security issues.
Also see **Q7.**

**Q6: Which "sensitive info" is Cryptomator for Android and iOS trying to access?**  
**A6:** To allow access to the files you have stored in Google Drive and to enable the associated functionality, the Cryptomator app needs access to your Google Drive.
Even if the message from Google sounds scary, this is nothing new and nothing to worry about.
Also see **Q7.**

**Q7: Why is this happening? Why is Google blocking Cryptomator for Android and iOS?**  
**A7:** To enable access to your files stored in Google Drive, Cryptomator needs both your permission and Google's consent. Google has recently adopted newer and stricter security policies that we must adhere to in order to continue to provide access to your Google Drive in the app. If we don't prove to Google in time that we comply with these guidelines, access will be blocked, which is what is happening right now. We are currently in the middle of this verification process to regain access, but this is quite time-consuming and labor-intensive, all of which has led to this situation.

**Q8: What about Cryptomator for Desktop?**  
**A8:** The affected functionality is not offered by Cryptomator for Desktop, so there currently is no problem there.
