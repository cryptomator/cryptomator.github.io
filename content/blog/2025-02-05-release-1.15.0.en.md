We are excited to introduce the latest version of Cryptomator, version 1.15.0! This update not only brings a redesigned user interface but also new features and many improvements. Letâ€™s take a closer look at the highlights of this release.

## Whatâ€™s New?

### Improved User Interface

- **Redesigned Main Window**: The main window has been revamped to better integrate the app into the system and its design. Additionally, the new layout enhances navigation and groups essential functions so that they are more easily accessible to users.
- **Compact Vault List**: The vault list now offers a compact view, which can be enabled in the settings. In this mode, only the vault name is displayedâ€”especially useful for those managing multiple vaults!

### Enhanced Compatibility & New Features

- **New Language**: Cryptomator is now available in Uyghur! A huge thank you to our community for this contribution. If youâ€™d like to help with translations, visit us [here](https://translate.cryptomator.org). 
- **Zero Dependency AppImage**: The AppImage no longer requires libfuse (version 2) to start. This makes the AppImage fully self-contained and compatible with almost all Linux systems.
- **Certificate Store**: Cryptomator now uses the systemâ€™s certificate stores (macOS, Windows) or a custom PKCS12 file (Linux) for HTTPS connections. This change ensures better compatibility with enterprise environments where custom certificates are used.
- **Improved Error Handling When Unlocking**: If a vault is read-only, this is now indicated to the user, and a retry in read-only mode is possible. This ensures greater transparency, prevents unexpected issues, and allows access to files even in restricted environments.

## Bugfixes

- A bug in the **cryptographic file system** has been fixed. In very rare cases, the cryptographic content of a file became corrupted when writing and truncating simultaneously. The bug was discovered through our automated tests and was quickly resolved.
- **Supporter Certificate Management**: It is now possible to manage the supporter certificate. Once entered, it is hidden if valid and can only be removed. This prevents easy marking and copying, enhancing certificate security.
- Vaults can be added to **Dolphinâ€™s Quick Access** again. This makes navigation and access to encrypted files easier for KDE users.

## Other Changes 

- **Updated to JDK 23** and **JavaFX 23.0.1** for better performance and stability, ensuring compatibility with modern development standards.
- **Updated translations** for many supported languages, ensuring a better user experience across different regions.
