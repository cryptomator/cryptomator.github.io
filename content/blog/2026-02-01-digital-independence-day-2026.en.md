**Every first Sunday of the month** this year, people around the world take a moment to reflect on their digital habits. The occasion is **Digital Independence Day** — a day of action for digital self-determination, privacy, and independence from tech monopolies.

But what does **digital independence** actually mean? And more importantly: How can you take your first steps without completely changing your digital everyday life or investing a lot of time and energy?

## What Is Digital Independence Day?

Digital Independence Day is an initiative that encourages people to **reduce their dependence on large, centralized tech platforms** — especially those whose business models are based on data collection, lock-in effects, and a lack of transparency.

Instead of calling for radical change, the movement deliberately focuses on **small, practical steps** that are accessible to everyone.

On the **official [Digital Independence Day](https://di.day/) website**, you’ll find ideas, tools, and easy guides to help you get started right away — from communication and social media to cloud storage and online services.

At its core, Digital Independence Day stands for:

- **less dependence** on tech monopolies
- **more control** over your own data
- **conscious use** of privacy-friendly alternatives

## Why Digital Independence Matters

Today, much of our digital lives takes place on just a few platforms. They store our documents, organize our communication, and influence which information we see.

This **concentration of power** has consequences:

- loss of data sovereignty
- opaque data usage and profiling
- limited freedom of choice
- political and economic dependencies

Digital independence **does not mean rejecting technology**. It means **regaining agency** and using tools that respect users, promote openness, and enable real control over data.

## Digital Independence Doesn’t Have to Be Complicated

There is a common assumption that digital independence requires technical expertise or hours of research. In reality, many impactful steps can be taken **in just a few minutes**.

Here are a few examples inspired by Digital Independence Day:

**1. Try decentralized social networks**

Instead of relying on a centralized platform like Facebook or X, you can try decentralized networks such as **Mastodon**. Mastodon works similarly to traditional social networks, but it is not controlled by a single company. You can choose a provider, switch if needed, and still stay connected to the entire network.

The official [Digital Independence Day](https://di.day/category/rezepte/) website offers easy starting points and explanations.

**2. Be more conscious about cloud storage**

Cloud services are convenient, but they often mean that **unencrypted data is stored with third-party providers**. A simple first step toward digital independence is **client-side encryption**: your files are encrypted before they leave your device. This is exactly where **Cryptomator** comes in.

With Cryptomator, you can continue using your existing cloud provider **while staying in control of your data**. The provider stores only encrypted files — the keys remain with you. No provider switch. No complicated setup. But significantly more control.

**3. Replace one tool at a time**

You don’t have to change everything at once. Instead, start by **focusing on one area**:

- messaging
- cloud storage
- social media
- password management

Replace just one tool with a more **privacy-friendly alternative**. That alone is already a meaningful step. **Digital independence is a process** — not a to-do list. That’s why Digital Independence Day focuses on small actions that anyone can easily take in everyday life.

## Why We Support Digital Independence Day

At Cryptomator, we believe that **privacy and control should not be a luxury**. They should be the standard and accessible to everyone. Digital Independence Day aligns perfectly with this belief. It empowers people to make informed decisions without pressure and without fear-mongering.

That’s why we support the initiative and invite our community to take part — not just for one day, but continuously.

## Digital Independence Day Special — February Edition

To support your first (or next) step toward digital independence, we’re continuing our campaign: On the **first Sunday of February**, we’re giving away **100 Cryptomator voucher codes — for free**.

The codes will be shared on our social media channels and are available on a **first come, first served** basis.

Our goal: to lower the barrier to entry and make digital self-determination accessible to as many people as possible.
