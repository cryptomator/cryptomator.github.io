summary: As you know, we're providing Cryptomator as a pay-what-you-want software and we want to keep it that way. In the meantime, we've grown to a small team working full time on this project. And we all need to pay our bills. Therefore we need your help! If you use Cryptomator in your company or know a company that uses open-source software, please ask if they want to become an official sponsor of Cryptomator. Alternatively, you can support Cryptomator through recurring donations.

Dear community,

As you know, we're providing Cryptomator as a pay-what-you-want software and we want to keep it that way. In the meantime, we've grown to a small team working full time on this project. And we all need to pay our bills.

Therefore we need your help! If you use Cryptomator in your company or know a company that uses open-source software, please ask if they want to become an official sponsor of Cryptomator. Alternatively, you can support Cryptomator through [recurring donations](https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/#donate).

We have prepared three sponsoring plans with different benefits for you. Head on to our [sponsors page](https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/) for more information.

Your Cryptomator team
