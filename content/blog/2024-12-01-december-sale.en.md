## Buy Once, Use Forever – And Get In Before the Price Increase

With our December sale, we want to give you the opportunity to buy Cryptomator at a great price before we increase prices next year. The current price is 14.99 €\*, and with the 33%\* discount in December, you'll only pay 9.99 €\*. In the new year, the price will increase to 19.99 €\*.

Our one-time purchase price continues to offer an excellent value. While competitors use a subscription model with ongoing costs, we want to ensure that with Cryptomator, you won't face any additional expenses in the long run. You only pay a one-time fixed price and can use the app for life. With a competitor's subscription model, you'd cover the cost of Cryptomator within just a few months.

## Open Source for Maximum Transparency

Cryptomator remains open source! This means our source code is always available for the public to review – ensuring maximum transparency and trust. We're proud to offer the community an open product and still rely on your support – be it through [feedback](/contact/), [donations](/donate/), or [sponsorship](/sponsors/). Your input helps us continually improve Cryptomator and make it even more secure.

## Purchasing Power Parity: New Pricing Structure for Fairness

Due to high demand, we've introduced purchasing power parity for our users. This means our prices are now adjusted to reflect the purchasing power in different countries. We aim to make our software fairly accessible worldwide. If you feel your country is not yet optimally considered, we'd love to hear your feedback. We are continuously working to improve our offering.

## Final Note

Our special discount offer runs throughout December – we've never had a sale this long before! We want to give you the opportunity to review the offers at your own pace and make an informed decision before the price increase in the new year. 

We wish you a secure and relaxing December – and look forward to continuing to support you in protecting your data in the new year!
