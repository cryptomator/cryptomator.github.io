It's hard to believe that Cryptomator Hub is already two years old! As a central management platform for encrypted cloud storage solutions, Cryptomator Hub enables businesses and organizations to securely and efficiently manage access and permissions. Since its release on November 2, 2022, we've worked hard with our community to develop an even stronger and more secure tool to meet your needs. First of all, a huge thank you to the community! To celebrate this milestone, we're introducing exciting new features – and the best part: you can test them now in a beta version!

## "Web of Trust" – Enhanced Security through Mutual Verification

Our brand-new "Web of Trust" feature adds an extra layer of security to your Cryptomator instance. Until now, users could verify others, but now we're taking it a step further: once a verification is made, it's automatically signed and shared, making it possible for others to see when someone has been marked as trustworthy. This creates a network where trust and authenticity become visible.

This feature allows teams to see at a glance how trustworthy someone is within the network, based on prior verifications by other users. It's especially beneficial for organizations that prioritize secure collaboration and high authenticity, as it makes trust visible and traceable within the platform.

## "Create-Vaults Role" – Precise Control Over Vault Creation

With the "Create-Vaults Role," admins now have the ability to precisely control who can create their own vaults within the Hub. Previously, anyone in the Hub could create new vaults, but now, permissions can be finely configured. For instance, admins can decide that only certain departments, such as IT or HR, can create new vaults. This function ensures clear structure, prevents unwanted vaults, and adapts to your organization's unique needs. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for larger teams.

## Test the Beta Now!

These features are available in the beta version and are waiting for you to try them out. Give us your feedback and help us fine-tune these functions before the official release. The full rollout is planned for the coming weeks – until then, we look forward to your support and insights!
