## What's New?

### Support for Box

One of the most significant changes in this version is the introduction of support for [box.com](https://box.com/). Users who securely store their data on Box can now manage encrypted vaults directly within the Box cloud using Cryptomator. Until April 2023, access to Box was possible via WebDAV, but this connection was discontinued by Box. With this update, access to Box is now available again, with a direct and native integration.

### New Language Support

Cryptomator 2.6 is becoming even more international and user-friendly: the app is now available in Slovenian and Ukrainian. Expanding language options reflects our commitment to providing simple and secure access to people worldwide. With this update, we aim to offer the best possible user experience to users from various regions.

A big thank you goes to our community, which constantly supports us in making the app accessible to more countries. If you're interested in contributing to translations, feel free to visit: <https://translate.cryptomator.org/>

## Bug Fixes

### OneDrive: "Unauthorized" Error Fixed

A bug affecting many OneDrive users has finally been fixed. When uploading files, some users encountered the "Unauthorized" error, which caused significant disruptions. This issue has been resolved in version 2.6, and uploads should now work smoothly.

### Removed Option: "Change Password" for Hub Vaults

The "Change Password" option for Hub vaults has been removed, as Hub vaults do not have individual vault passwords. However, users can still change their passwords for password-based vaults.

## Final Thoughts

Cryptomator 2.6 for iOS brings several important improvements and new features designed to help you manage your data more securely and efficiently. Whether it's the new support for Box, international translations, or bug fixes â€“ this update is focused on optimizing the use of Cryptomator on iOS.

We greatly appreciate your ongoing feedback and support. Try out the new version and let us know what you think!
