Last year in April, we started to rebuild our iOS app from scratch. That's why we decided to develop Cryptomator 2.0 in Swift. This will make it easier for us to maintain the app in the future.

Of course, the new app also comes with some new features. With Cryptomator 2.0, you get an app that is completely integrated into Apple's own Files app. This means that your vaults are directly accessible from there. For example, you can now save and edit a Word document directly in an encrypted vault via the Files app. In addition, features like thumbnails, grid view, swiping through images, and drag & drop are possible with the new app.

Transparency is also very important to us with Cryptomator 2.0. Therefore, the entire Cryptomator family, including the new app, remains fully open source. You can check out the repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/cryptomator/ios).

But we didn't stop there. For the first time, the new app is available as a "freemium" app. This means that in the free version, you can access your vaults in "read-only" mode. If you only need quick access to your vaults on the go, which were created with the Desktop application, then this is the perfect "companion" app. If you don't want to miss out on write access to your vaults, you can unlock the full version via a one-time purchase for $11.99 after a 30-day trial.

As promised, users of our old Cryptomator app can switch to the new app for free. We have tried to make the upgrade as easy as possible for you. All you have to do is make sure that the previous app is up to date when you start the new app so that you can select the upgrade option. To make the transition easier for you, the previous app will be available in the App Store for a short transition period.

At this point, we would like to thank you once again for your support, without which the project would not have been possible. :blush:

We are already looking forward to your feedback! :robot:
