Cryptomator has been redesigned and comes with a new dark mode. It is not simply a redesign, it was a full rewrite of the UI. During the rewrite, a whole new code structure was planned which makes it easier to extend the application in the future. One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don't feel too comfortable with encryption software. Usability tests helped designing the workflows and understanding common misconceptions. Besides the redesign, the new vault format 7 increases compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduces the complexity for certain I/O operations.

To support the ongoing open-source development of Cryptomator, consider [buying a donation key](/de/donate/), which unlocks the new dark mode. :heart: {{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.5.0" "Detailed release notes" >}} for the desktop app are available on GitHub.
