## What’s New?

**Windows Hello Integration**

Starting now, you can unlock your vaults on Windows using **Windows Hello** — whether via facial recognition, fingerprint, or PIN. Added security meets maximum convenience. Once again, big thanks to [Ralph (purejava on GitHub)](https://github.com/purejava) for contributing to this feature!

**Double-Click to Unlock Vaults**

You can now unlock your vaults by simply **double-clicking the** `vault.cryptomator` **file** — no need to open the app interface first. This makes accessing frequently used vaults even easier.

**Updated Graphical Framework: JavaFX 24**

Under the hood, Cryptomator's graphical foundation has been updated to **JavaFX 24**. This not only brings greater stability but also improves compatibility with modern systems.

## What’s Fixed?

**WinFsp Update: Blue Screen on Windows Resolved**

One of the most important updates concerns the **WinFsp driver**, which Cryptomator uses to mount vaults. The update to the latest version fixes a critical bug that, in combination with certain Trend Micro security products, could cause a blue screen.

**Legacy Vaults Can Be Imported Again**

A pesky bug has been squashed: **Importing legacy vaults now works smoothly again**. So if you have older backups, you can now restore them without any issues in this version.

You can find all the other changes in the [changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.17.0)!

### And what about Windows ARM?

Unfortunately, the native ARM app for Windows must be postponed due to a bug in the JDK framework. We are working on a fix but cannot announce a release date yet.

## Update Now!

Cryptomator 1.17.0 is available as usual via our download page. We highly recommend updating.
