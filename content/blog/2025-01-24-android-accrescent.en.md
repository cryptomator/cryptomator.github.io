## Cryptomator for Android Now on Accrescent

We are excited to announce that Cryptomator for Android is now available on [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/app/org.cryptomator), a privacy-focused app store with robust security features.

This addition complements our existing distribution channels, including [Google Play](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/android/setup/#google-play-store), [APK Store](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/android/setup/#apk-store), and F-Droid (both [our repository](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/android/setup/#cryptomator-f-droid-repository) and the [main repository](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/android/setup/#main-f-droid-repository)). So why did we choose to add another distribution channel?

## Why Accrescent?

Accrescent aligns with our core values of security, privacy, and user control. It requires no user account and provides features such as signed repository metadata, app signing key pinning, and minimum version enforcement, ensuring that Cryptomator remains a trusted and secure choice for Android users.

Additionally, Accrescent is the preinstalled app store on some Android variants such as [GrapheneOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS), making it an ideal addition to our distribution strategy.

## Commitment to Security and Transparency

Publishing Cryptomator on Accrescent aligns with our core principles. Our primary concern has always been security, privacy and transparency, which is why we value features like app signing key control, verifiable metadata, and the fact that no account is required for usage.

Each distribution channel we provide offers its own unique benefits and trade-offs, catering to different user needs and preferences. For instance, we appreciate the main F-Droid repository for its [reproducible build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) approach, where F-Droid itself builds our APK from the publicly available source code and verifies that the resulting binaries match our published versions. This process provides an additional layer of transparency and trust.

## Conclusion

By making Cryptomator available on [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/app/org.cryptomator), we are broadening our reach to privacy-conscious users and ensuring a secure distribution channel that aligns with our mission to protect your data. Whether you choose Google Play, APK Store, F-Droid, or Accrescent, you can always rely on Cryptomator for secure, open-source encryption.

We appreciate your continued support and feedback. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!
