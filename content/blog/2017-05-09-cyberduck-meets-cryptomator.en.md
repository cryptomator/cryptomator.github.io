Cyberduck 6.0 with support for Cryptomator vaults has been released today. You can download the new version at {{<extlink "https://cyberduck.io/" "cyberduck.io">}}. Cyberduck is a libre remote file browser for Mac and Windows, making it the perfect tool for all, who do not want to synchronize their cloud files locally.

Cyberduck allows access to your cloud storage without an additional sync client. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure & OneDrive, and OpenStack Swift are some of the supported protocols. All vaults created with Cyberduck or Cryptomator can be opened with the other.
