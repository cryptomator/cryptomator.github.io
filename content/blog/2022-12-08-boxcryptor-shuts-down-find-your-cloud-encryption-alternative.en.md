## How to Migrate From Boxcryptor to Cryptomator

Switching from Boxcryptor to Cryptomator is simple. Boxcryptor provides an [off-migration guide](https://support.boxcryptor.com/en/help/faq-and-troubleshooting/#migration-guide) on their website to decrypt all Boxcryptor encrypted files. Make sure that your sensitive data is at no point unencrypted in the cloud. Then, you set up Cryptomator so you can encrypt and securely sync those files back to the cloud.

### How to Easily Set Up Cryptomator

1. [Download](/downloads/) and install Cryptomator.
2. Once Cryptomator is installed, you can create a new vault. 
3. Give your vault a name. 
4. Now select a cloud storage of your choice as the storage location of your vault. 
5. Enter a password.

And you have successfully created your first vault.

If you want, you can unlock it immediately and reveal the virtual drive. From now on, you can store your sensitive files here, e.g., the data that you previously encrypted with Boxcryptor, in order to encrypt them in the cloud with Cryptomator from now on.
