summary: Cryptomator has been rewritten with a modular core, introducing features like auto-unlock, a new vault format, performance improvements, and enhanced compatibility. We've switched to IntelliJ, updated to GPLv3, and dropped 32-bit support. iOS and Android updates include compatibility with vault format 6, bug fixes, and new features like fingerprint support on Android, with more updates on the way.

We've completely rewritten Cryptomator. Its core components are now modularized to {{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" "CryptoLib">}}, {{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs" "CryptoFS">}}, and {{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter" "WebDAV-NIO-Adapter">}}. A complete list of closed issues is available {{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/26?closed=1" "here" >}}.

### Improvements
- Auto-Unlock!!! :tada: ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40" "#40" >}}) We finally implemented the most-wished feature. Still experimental and will be completed by autostart (optionally hidden) in future versions
- New vault format 6 ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/521" "#521" >}})
- Added new options to "unlocked" screen: Mount/unmount without locking/unlocking ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/452" "#452" >}})
- Network access now filtered by the socket instead of the application ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" "#431" >}})
- You can now change the socket port without restarting Cryptomator
- New log system with log file rotation and exposed, user-adjustable configuration

#### Windows
- Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount `cryptomator-vault` which is mapped to `127.0.0.1` ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" "#512">}}, {{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" "#529" >}})

#### macOS
- Improved macOS Sierra integration, unlocking doesn't ask for username/password for `localhost` anymore ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170" "#170" >}})
- Improved iCloud Drive compatibility ({{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/364" "#364" >}})
- Fixed slow startup on some systems
- Added `CMD+,` shortcut for preferences

### Misc
- Changed license to GPLv3
- Dropped SHA-1 signatures in Windows Authenticode code signing
- Dropped official Windows Vista support
- Dropped official Ubuntu Vivid and Wily support

### Technical Details on Windows Mounting
After we have fixed {{< extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" "#431">}}, we noticed various issues on Windows. We tried hosting the virtual drive via `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings ({{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" "#529">}}), and sometimes Office didn't properly work ({{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" "#512" >}}). That's why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host `cryptomator-vault` (which is mapped to `127.0.0.1`) into the `hosts` file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don't quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!

### Under-The-Hood Improvements
We'd like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!
