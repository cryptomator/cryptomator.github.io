## New Features: What’s New in 1.18.0?

### Restoring the Vault Configuration File

The **recovery key** has been part of Cryptomator for some time, but with version 1.18.0, it is now significantly more powerful: You can now **completely restore lost or damaged master key files and vault configuration files** using your existing recovery key.

Whether accidentally deleted, overwritten due to a backup problem, or damaged by a memory error, the vault can now be **reliably reconstructed**.

This makes the recovery key a real emergency tool that secures access to the vault in case of an emergency and prevents complete data loss.

### New Signature Certificates for Windows

The Windows installer and all binary files are **signed with a new certificate**. The old certificate is no longer valid, and the new certificate ensures smooth installation on modern Windows systems without disruptive warning dialogs.

### Remembering the Last Vault Location

When creating a new vault, Cryptomator now automatically suggests the **last location used**. Users who create multiple vaults in similar folder structures benefit from a **significantly faster setup process**.

## Bug Fixes & Platform Improvements

### macOS 26: Correct Display of the App Icon – And No "Squircle Jail" for Cryptomator

On macOS 26 (codename "Tahoe"), the **Cryptomator icon** was put inside a generic grey squircle, which didn't look right. This issue has been fixed in version 1.18.0, so the icon now appears as it should.

With Tahoe, Apple now enforces squircle-shaped icons for all macOS apps—similar to the strict guidelines that have always applied to iOS. Previously, macOS apps could escape the squircle more freely, and many apps used this playfully as part of their visual identity. But now, app icons must conform to the squircle shape. We're joining the **squircle resistance** alongside other app developers who are keeping their distinctive icon designs instead of conforming to this new guideline.

### macFUSE Detection on macOS 26

Some users experienced problems integrating vaults because macFUSE was not always recognized on macOS 26. This bug has now been fixed, so vaults can be opened reliably again.

### Windows: Control Over Log File Sizes

In rare cases, log files on Windows could grow enormously and cause system problems. The size limit of the log files has been corrected so that Cryptomator runs reliably and conserves resources in the background again.

### Linux/KDE: Cleaning Up QuickAccess Entries

Under KDE, the Dolphin file manager created a new QuickAccess entry every time a vault was unlocked—even if one already existed, for example after the app was unexpectedly closed. This behavior has now been corrected. Existing entries are reused, and unnecessary duplications are a thing of the past.

## Further Changes & Technical Updates

- **Update of the UI framework to JavaFX 25**: improved performance, modern graphics display, and long-term compatibility.
- **New “Share” entry in the context menu** that explains how to share vaults.
- Various **security and library updates** (including nimbus-jose-jwt, logback, commons-lang3, dagger) to keep the software up to date and secure.

## Why This Update Is Important

Version 1.18.0 makes Cryptomator Desktop **more robust, user-friendly, and better prepared for future operating system versions**. The new recovery feature protects in critical scenarios (e.g., damaged configuration files), while UI and system improvements make everyday use of Cryptomator smoother.
