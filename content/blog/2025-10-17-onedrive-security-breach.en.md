In **May 2025**, the **Oasis Security** published an [analysis](https://www.oasis.security/blog/onedrive-file-picker-security-flaw-oasis-research) that caused a stir in the cloud world: **a vulnerability in OneDrive File Picker** allowed third-party applications to access files for which they did not actually have access rights. **Millions of users** were affected, both private individuals and companies.

What exactly happened, why is this incident so explosive, and what can you learn from it to better protect your own data?

## What Went Wrong With Onedrive File Picker?

OneDrive File Picker is a popular interface that allows apps to access files from personal cloud storage. However, Oasis Security discovered that **certain configuration** errors allowed applications to view and download files that they did not officially have access to – even sensitive content such as tax documents, project plans, or confidential meeting minutes.

Worse still, the affected applications did not even need to use an exploit – all they had to do was use the File Picker correctly (or rather, incorrectly). **The problem was not a targeted hack, but a design flaw in the system.**

## The Real Lesson: Trust Is Not a Security Concept

Many users trust cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple to keep their data secure. But this incident shows that even large platforms make mistakes—with far-reaching consequences.

The **real problem** runs deeper:

- **Access rights** are managed in the backend, not by the user(s) themselves.
- Files are often stored **unencrypted** on servers—or only with a key that the provider itself controls.
- **Security vulnerabilities in third-party apps or web interfaces** can be exploited without those affected even noticing.

**In short**: anyone who entrusts their data exclusively to the security promises of cloud providers is relinquishing control.

## The Solution: Zero-Knowledge Encryption With Cryptomator

Cryptomator takes a fundamentally different approach: **files are encrypted locally on your device before being uploaded to the cloud**. This means your data remains protected even if the cloud provider is compromised—or, as in the case of OneDrive, simply makes a mistake.

This means:

- **No one** but you can read your files—not Microsoft, not Google, not us.
- **Access rights** are secondary, because without the key, all data remains unreadable.
- Even **compromised** APIs or third-party apps only see encrypted garbage data.

**Cryptomator Hub** offers the ideal extension for teams, organizations, and companies:

- **Centralized management of encrypted vaults**  
  IT administrators can preconfigure vaults and share them with specific users—all with end-to-end encryption.
- **Role-based access control**  
  Thanks to the role-based system, you can specify exactly who is allowed to create, open, or manage vaults—without central key distribution.
- **Web of trust for secure collaboration**  
  Team members verify each other, creating a trustworthy environment—without the need for external certificate authorities.
- **Seamless integration into existing cloud workflows**  
  Cryptomator Hub can be easily combined with existing cloud storage solutions such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox.

Cryptomator Hub enables **highly secure and practical cloud usage within teams** without the usual compromises in data protection and compliance. This is a future-proof solution, especially for organizations with increased requirements, such as **NGOs, research institutions, or companies in regulated industries**.

## What You Can Do Now

Whether you use OneDrive, Dropbox, or another cloud service, this incident shows that **no provider can offer 100% security** on its own. However, you can drastically reduce your risks by taking a few simple steps:

- Use **client-side encryption** with tools such as Cryptomator.
- Do not store particularly sensitive documents unencrypted in the cloud.
- **Raise awareness among your team members** or colleagues about cloud access rights.
- Check which third-party apps have access to your cloud.

## Conclusion: Safety Begins With Control

The OneDrive security breach is not an isolated incident—it is a symptom of a system that relies on trust rather than real control. But if you **encrypt your files before uploading them**, you remain protected even in the event of serious security breaches.

With Cryptomator, you retain full control over your data, your privacy, and your digital security.
