With the release of version 1.4.0, **Cryptomator Hub** receives a major feature upgrade that offers more control and transparency — while also improving the overall user experience.

At the heart of this release are a new **Web of Trust**, finer-grained **permission management**, extended **audit logging**, and deeper **insights into user profiles**.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s new!

## Web of Trust: Mutual Verification for Better Security

One of the highlights of this release is the new **Web of Trust (WoT)**. Users can now mutually verify each other's identities by signing public keys. This creates a network of trust that protects against the injection of manipulated or forged public keys.

This feature directly addresses so-called **"key injection" risks** and strengthens the protection of sensitive data across organizations.

The verification process is based on a simple but effective principle: **Only when a person’s public key is confirmed by trusted peers is their identity considered verified.**

Admins can configure how many verifications are required.

## New Create-Vaults Role: Granular Permissions for Vault Creation

With the introduction of the new `create-vaults` role, admins now have full control over who is allowed to create new vaults within the organization.

Previously, this permission was available to all users by default — now, admins can specify whether only certain teams, individuals, or everyone should have access to this feature.

Especially in large organizations, this is a key improvement for maintaining order and managing infrastructure growth in a more controlled way.

## Audit Log: Even More Precise Activity Tracking

Monitoring security-relevant actions is a key responsibility in IT operations. With version 1.4.0, the **audit log** becomes even more powerful:

- **Filter by event type:** You can now filter audit log entries by type — such as key changes, access attempts, or account activity — to quickly isolate relevant data during incidents.
- **New events:** Several new [event types](https://docs.cryptomator.org/hub/admin/#event-types) were added to better capture security-critical actions.
  - **Register Device** – A user registered a new device, e.g., Cryptomator app or browser session.
  - **Remove Device** – A user removed a device.
  - **Signed Identity** – A user signed another user’s identity.
  - **Account Key Changed** – A user regenerated their account key, which also affects user keys.
  - **Reset User Account** – A user reset their account.
  - **User Keys Change** – A user changed their keys, e.g., during initial setup or account key updates.
  - **Claim Vault Ownership** – A user claimed ownership of a vault that was created with a Hub version prior to 1.3.0 using the Vault Admin Password.
- **Retrieve Vault Key event enhanced:** This audit event now includes the **IP address and device ID** — making it easier to trace who unlocked a vault and from which device.

## More Transparency in User Profile

The user interface has also been updated to offer more transparency about devices and access patterns:

- **Legacy devices:** Users can now see if they’re still using devices linked to vaults created with older versions of the Hub. This helps with migrations to the current user-key-based encryption introduced in version 1.3.0.
- **Last IP and vault access timestamp:** The device overview now shows the **last known IP address** and the **most recent vault access timestamp** for each device — ideal for identifying suspicious activity.

## New Languages and Improved Usability

- **More language support:** Cryptomator Hub is now available in **Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Turkish** — making it even more accessible for international teams.
- **Language preference is preserved:** Your selected language setting is now saved in your user profile and no longer resets after logout.

## Provenance Attestation for Container Images

A frequently overlooked but critical area of security is the **authenticity of software containers**. Starting with version 1.4.0, we now publish **provenance attestations** for our container images.

These attestations document the origin and integrity of our images and provide additional assurance for automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines.

## Full Changelog

## Closing Remarks

**Cryptomator Hub 1.4.0** is a release that builds trust — through greater visibility, more refined controls, and solid technical foundations.

Whether it’s security management, role-based permissions, or user-facing transparency: This update lays the groundwork for even more robust data infrastructures in organizations that take encryption seriously.
