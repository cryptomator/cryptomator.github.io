We're happy to announce the release of Cryptomator 1.10.0. :tada: Let's dive into what this new release has to offer!

## Expert Settings During Vault Creation

We understand that expert users desire more control and would like to override some default values in the vault configuration file. That's why the new version brings the addition of expert settings during vault creation. For now, you can set the maximum length of encrypted file names. This feature ensures that Cryptomator adapts to the peculiarities of various cloud storage systems. :hammer_and_wrench:

## Proper Tray Menu Support on Linux

A huge shoutout to [Ralph (purejava on GitHub)](https://github.com/purejava) for his open-source contribution once again! :raised_hands: Thanks to his efforts, we now have proper tray menu support with AppIndicator integration. It's yet another step towards making Cryptomator feel native and fluid for Linux users.

## AArch64 Build for AppImage

Good news for Linux users on AArch64 architectures! :tada: Cryptomator 1.10.0 includes an AArch64 build for AppImage. With this addition, we're expanding our reach and welcome more Linux users.

## Improved Error Dialog

Encountering an error can be frustrating :sweat:, especially when you're not sure what to do next. We've redesigned our error dialog to focus on solutions. Now, when you run into an error, the dialog will guide you to a potential solution if it exists in our error database. This enhancement aims to make troubleshooting more user-friendly and efficient. :white_check_mark:
