</figure>

PowerFolder integrates the German encryption software Cryptomator into its proven sync and share solution. This makes PowerFolder's encryption even more secure.  

The German company dal33t GmbH has been successfully developing and marketing file sync & share solutions under the brand name PowerFolder since 2007. The offering includes both public and integrated private cloud solutions (EFSS) as individualized on-premise services. Over four million users worldwide, most German universities and thousands of companies use PowerFolder. PowerFolder users can access their files from anywhere and also edit and share them together - even on the move via the PowerFolder app. Security is an absolute priority: data is always encrypted and stored on German servers in accordance with German data protection regulations. PowerFolder is supported by the Federal Ministry of Economics and has been awarded the "IT Security Made in Germany" seal.
