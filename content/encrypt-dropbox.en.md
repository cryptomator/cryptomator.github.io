# Encrypt Dropbox securely: How to protect your sensitive files in the cloud with Cryptomator

<p class="lead">You want to <strong>encrypt your Dropbox and protect your privacy</strong> – and still have all the freedom in how you organize your data? That's where Cryptomator comes in.</p>

<img class="inline-block" src="/img/encrypt-dropbox/cryptobot-unlocking-vault.png" srcset="/img/encrypt-dropbox/cryptobot-unlocking-vault.png 1x, /img/encrypt-dropbox/cryptobot-unlocking-vault@2x.png 2x" alt="Cryptobot Unlocking Vault" />

With Cryptomator, you can **encrypt your cloud storage** by creating a vault in Dropbox and putting your files into it. With this extra layer of security, you'll build an almost insurmountable barrier against attackers – without restricting Dropbox's file storage and synchronization.

## How Cryptomator secures your Dropbox encryption {#how-the-vault-works}

Cryptomator puts the data in your Dropbox into a "magic" vault. Magical because the entire vault and its contents only appear with the right password – and only to the person with the right password.

When the door to the vault is closed again, the entire vault and its valuable contents disappear again until the next time you open it with the right password.

This means that attackers would not even benefit from drilling through the wall of the vault. Because the vault is empty if the correct password is missing. (For Marvel fans: It works similarly to the portal in Doctor Strange).

    <p><strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> makes it even harder for potential attackers to harm you. That's because encrypted file names mean third parties can't draw conclusions about file types – which is one of the most common gateways for them to get in.</p>

    <p>Cryptomator is specifically designed to <strong>encrypt cloud services</strong>. Because the <strong>files are encrypted individually</strong>, only the files you just changed are uploaded or encrypted – and not (as with so-called "container solutions") the entire folder. Changes are synchronized much faster – and this is especially noticeable when you are on the road.</p>

## And this is how Cryptomator works in practice {#how-cryptomator-works}

If you want the vault to appear with your files, you first open Cryptomator. Now you enter your password and the vault appears (in the form of a virtual drive in your file explorer).

Never worked with a virtual drive before? A virtual drive works like a USB flash drive. So the drive is only visible as long as the USB stick is connected. If you eject the stick, the USB drive disappears again.

We call this virtual drive "vault drive". You can open it as usual and edit the data. As soon as you click "Lock Vault" in Cryptomator, the virtual drive is removed (and with it, the access to the sensitive data). The vault is now gone again.

By the way, you can create as many vaults as you like to organize your data individually.

## How to easily use Cryptomator with your Dropbox {#setup-guide}

1. Install Cryptomator.
2. Once Cryptomator is installed, you can create a new vault.
3. Give your vault a name.
4. Now select Dropbox as the storage location of your vault.
5. Enter a password.

And you have successfully created your first vault.

If you want, you can unlock it immediately and reveal the virtual drive.

Here you can store your sensitive files to encrypt them in Dropbox.
