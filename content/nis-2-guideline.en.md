## Introduction

In the wake of the new [NIS 2 Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/en), which comes into force in October 2024, companies will have to pay more attention to cyber security. Tools such as Cryptomator, which offers the highest security standards through end-to-end encryption and as [open source software](https://cryptomator.org/open-source/), can help to meet the new requirements.

## What is the NIS 2 Directive?

The NIS-2 Directive (Network and Information Systems Directive) comes into force in October 2024. This is a new EU regulation that aims to raise the standards of cyber security within the European Union. This directive extends the scope and requirements of the original NIS Directive to improve the resilience and security of critical infrastructure against cyber-attacks. It is aimed at a wide range of companies, including those in the energy, transportation, banking, healthcare and digital infrastructure sectors.

### Who is affected by the NIS 2 Directive?

The NIS 2 Directive affects all companies that are classified as providers of essential services and operators of critical infrastructure. This includes not only large companies, but also many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the sectors mentioned. These companies must now implement strict security measures to protect their networks and information systems.

Companies from the following sectors are particularly affected:

- **Energy:** Electricity, gas and oil suppliers must secure their networks against cyber attacks. This includes both physical and digital infrastructures.

- **Transportation:** Airlines, shipping companies, railroad companies and transport infrastructure operators must take cyber security measures to ensure smooth and secure operations.

- **Banking:** Financial institutions and payment service providers are required to protect their systems from data leaks and attacks to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of financial transactions.

- **Healthcare:** Hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and digital health service providers must protect sensitive patient data and ensure that their digital systems are secured against cyber threats.

- **Digital infrastructure:** Internet service providers, cloud services and data centers must secure their networks and data centers to ensure the availability and security of their services.

### Consequences of non-compliance

Non-compliance with the NIS 2 Directive can have serious consequences. Companies that do not meet the requirements can face significant fines and sanctions. In addition, inadequate cyber security can lead to serious security incidents that can cause both financial and reputational damage. Such incidents could disrupt operations, shake customer confidence and have a long-term negative impact on business.

## How Cryptomator can help

Cryptomator is an innovative solution that helps organizations meet the requirements of the NIS-2 directive and improve their cyber security standards. Cryptomator protects data from unauthorized access by encrypting it in a simple and effective way.

### Cryptomator features for NIS-2 compliance

Cryptomator offers a range of features that can help organizations meet the requirements of the NIS-2 directive:

- **End-to-end encryption:** Reliably protects data from unauthorized access, both during transmission and storage. This encryption technology ensures that only authorized users can access the data.

- **Zero-knowledge principle:** Only the users have access to their encrypted data; even the developers of Cryptomator do not have access. This guarantees maximum security and confidentiality.

- **Cross-platform availability:** Cryptomator supports various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android, which enables flexible and broad application.

- **Easy access and management:** The user-friendly interface allows even non-technical users to securely encrypt and manage data without the need for extensive technical knowledge.

- **Transparent encryption:** Files can still be edited with common applications without having to remove the encryption. This simplifies the work process and increases efficiency.

- **Open source software:** The source code is publicly accessible, which creates transparency and trust in the security measures. Users can check the code themselves and ensure that there are no backdoors.

### Cryptomator Hub: Security for teamwork

A special highlight is the [Cryptomator Hub](https://cryptomator.org/hub/), which has been specially developed for team collaboration. Cryptomator Hub offers additional functions for managing and sharing encrypted files in a team environment.

Here are some of the benefits of Cryptomator Hub:

- **Centralized management:** Manage access rights and encryption settings centrally for all team members. This simplifies administration and increases control over data security.

- **Secure collaboration:** Share files securely within the team without compromising encryption. This enables efficient and secure collaboration, even in distributed teams.
