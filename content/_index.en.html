        <h2>Take the security of your data into your own hands</h2>
        <p class="lead">Cryptomator is a simple tool for digital self-defense. It allows you to protect your cloud data by yourself and independently.</p>

          <span>Most cloud providers encrypt data only during transmission or they keep the keys for decryption for themselves. These keys can be stolen, copied, or misused. Thanks to Cryptomator, only you have the key to your data in your hand.</span>

        <h2>How does Cryptomator protect your data?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Cryptomator's technology meets the latest standards and encrypts both files and filenames with AES and 256 bit key length.</p>
        <div class="flex mb-4">
          <div class="fa-stack flex-shrink-0 text-xl text-secondary mr-3">
            <i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
            <i class="fas fa-key fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
          </div>
          <span>To start with Cryptomator, you assign a password for a folder - we call it a vault - within your cloud. That is all. No complicated key creation, no registration, no configuration!</span>
        </div>
        <div class="flex mb-4">
          <div class="fa-stack flex-shrink-0 text-xl text-secondary mr-3">
            <i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
            <i class="fas fa-hdd fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
          </div>
          <span>To access the vault, simply enter the password again. You will be provided with a virtual encrypted drive to which you can move your data - just like a USB flash drive. Every time you store something on this drive, Cryptomator encrypts the data automatically. Pretty simple, right?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="fa-stack flex-shrink-0 text-xl text-secondary mr-3">

            <i class="fas fa-shield-check fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
          </div>
          <span>The technology behind this is state-of-the-art and encrypts both files and filenames with AES and 256 bit key length. This means: if someone looks into the folder in your cloud, they cannot draw any conclusions about your data.</span>
